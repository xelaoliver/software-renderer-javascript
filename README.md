# Software Renderers in Javascript

Some attempts to make a simple, unbloated Javascript program that uses the HTML canvas API to draw 3D models (without shading, textures, ambient occlusion, etc...). I'd occasionally open my laptop, hop into Vim and reprogram the entire application!

# Why?

I wanted to make a simple graphics *API* that is minimal and only has the things that are essential to reduce file size. I'd go on to make a few iterations of this program (and learn a lot about Javascript) and then dump it soon after because I realised how difficult and limitating HTML/Javascript is. But at the time I thought this was fun, and it was.

I've also chopped together a simple python program which simplifies all of my Javascript versions so I can run it on School computers (to impress friends). This version lacks z-clipping so if you go too far into a triangle, you see it in reverse.
